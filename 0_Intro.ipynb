    "## Why Ray?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Ray's strengths align perfectly with the requirements for high-performance training, inference, and data processing with large AI models\n",
    "* The Ray AI libraries make those tasks straightforward while integrating closely with the industry standard tools like PyTorch and Lightning.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Anyscale?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ray is great open-source software. But Ray is focused on core capabilities for AI computation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Anyscale adds infrastructure management, enterprise-friendly features, and technical extensions that make Ray easy to deploy and operate."
